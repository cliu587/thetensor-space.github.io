`TheTensor.Space` is group of researchers making tools to tame tensors.
With the right tools tensors and multilinear algebra can be as natural
as working with vectors.  With `TheTensor.Space` and all of its derived 
packages we are dedicated to find the most efficient algorithms, 
transparent and flexible data structures, and expressive language
to smooth out the complexities of multilinear algebra.  As a research
group we are willing to throw out whats working and build an entirely 
new approach (but we cache the history so lessons don't get lost!).  
So look for changes, and suggest any you think we should try.

You can find the source code for our projects and a list of ongoing and future plans
here and at our GitHub website [thetensor-space.github.io](https://thetensor-space.github.io)
