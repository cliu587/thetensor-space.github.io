For example let us say that we have a algebraic structure $A$ with operations $[*,+,-,0]$ where $[+,-,0]$ makes a group (possibly not abelian) and $*$ nearly distributes over $+$, for example
$$
a*(b+c) \equiv a*b+a*c \pmod{\langle a,b,c\rangle^3}
$$
I.e. modulo any triple product of $\{a,b,c\}$ we have the distributive property 
if you have an pre-algebra $A$
