> **Definition.** The Waring rank of a homogeneous polynomial $f \in C[x_1, \ldots, x_n]_d$ is the minimum $r$ such that

> **Problem.** Give asymptotic bounds on A(n,d), the minimum Waring rank among all polynomials in $C[x_1, \ldots, x_n]_d$ whose support is the set of all squarefree monomials of degree $d$ in $n$ variables. 

I know that
$$
2^{d-1} \le A(n,d) \le O(\min(6.75^d, 4.075^d \log n)).
$$
