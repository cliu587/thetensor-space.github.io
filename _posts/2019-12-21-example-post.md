## Create an Article, Event, or other post
<span id="create-post"></span>

Posts for Articles and Events are kept in the following directories (as of writing this):

* `_posts` -> Articles Page
* `_events` -> Events Page

To create a new post, add a file with the markdown file extension (`.md`). Jekyll uses [Kramdown](https://kramdown.gettalong.org/documentation.html) for processing these files. **It is important** that you follow Jekyll's naming conventions for a post as follows: `YYYY-MM-DD-YOUR_POST_NAME.md`. This is how Jekyll organizes and sorts your posts correctly.

For example, this is how you create a new _post_ for the _Articles_ page:

1. Create a file named `2019-12-21-tensors-rock.md` in the `_posts` directory.
2. Insure you have the proper _Front Matter_ for your post. An _Article_ has the following Front Matter:
   
   ```
   ---
   # Uses this html: "_layout/post.html" as a template.
   layout: post 
   title:  Post Template
   # (Optional) Used to sort posts, not supported as of writing this.
   categories: [ Workshops ]
   ---
   ```
3. Write your article. Use this post template or [Kramdown's documentation](https://kramdown.gettalong.org/documentation.html) for any markdown questions / issues you have.
4. Confirm your article shows up on the site.


## Use KaTex
<span id="use-katex"></span>

Use [KaTex](https://katex.org/docs/supported.html) to draw Math formulas directly in `Markdown`. KaTex uses `LaTeX` and `TeX` macros to parse math formulas. [See the Katex docs](https://katex.org/docs/supported.html) for a full list of `LaTeX` and `TeX` macros.B elow is a simple example of using Katex:
```
_Today we'll go over the Pythagorean Theorem..._

$$
a^{2} + b^{2} = c^{2}
$$

# Inline mode:

$
a^{2} + b^{2} = c^{2}  
$
```

...Which results in the following output:

_Today we'll go over the Pythagorean Theorem..._


$$
a^{2} + b^{2} = c^{2}
$$

$
a^{2} + b^{2} = c^{2}
$

## Add a Video
<span id="add-video"></span>

* Get the _source_ of a video. For Vimeo videos, you can get the source of the video by clicking _share_ then copying the _link_ shown in the popup. For YouTube, right-click a video and choose _copy video url_.
   
   * You can also add videos to the site in the `/uploads/videos` directory, but it is not recommended to keep videos in your code repository.

![Vimeo video example](/uploads/images/vimeo_src_example.png)

* Once you have the _source_ of a video, use the code below as a template:

```
{% raw %}
  {% 
    include video.html
    src="https://vimeo.com/379509939"
    title="Tensors & Operators -- James B. Wilson"
    desc="Introduction to Tensors, Tensor Spaces, and Transverse Operators. TACA 2019. For more visit https://TheTensor.Space/. Creative Commons 2.0 CC-BY 2019 James B. Wilson"
  %}
{% endraw %}
```

...which will result in the following output:

{% 
  include video.html
  src="https://vimeo.com/379509939"
  title="Tensors & Operators -- James B. Wilson"
  desc="Introduction to Tensors, Tensor Spaces, and Transverse Operators. Creative Commons 2.0 CC-BY 2019 James B. Wilson"
%}

## Add an image
<span id="add-image"></span>

It is not recommended to keep images in your code repository, but at a small scale it is acceptable (this is because _Git_ tracks _every_ image and slows down version control and for other reasons).

Use the following markdown as a template to add an image to a post:

```
{% raw %}
  Use an image in the /uploads/images directory:

  ![Vimeo video example](/uploads/images/vimeo_src_example.png)

  Or, use an external image (Be sure the image won't be removed in the future):

  ![Text that is shown if the image fails to load](https://URL_TO_YOUR_IMAGE)

{% endraw %}
```

## Edit a non-post page
<span id="edit-page"></span>

All non-post pages are mostly located in the root directory. For example, _About_, _Home_, and _Contact_ pages can be found in the root directory as `about.md`, `index.md`, and `contact.md`.

## Documentation
<span id="more-docs"></span>

A full list of documentation for the site can be found on the [documentation page](/docs/tensors).

## Contributing
<span id="how-to-contribute"></span>
When you'd like to contribute to the website, you'll need to follow these steps:

1. [Fork](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/) our repository, [thetensor-space/thetensor-space.github.io](https://github.com/thetensor-space/thetensor-space.github.io).
1. Clone your fork onto your local machine with [Git](https://guides.github.com/introduction/git-handbook/).
1. Create a new branch with a descriptive name like `article-squid-membranes`.
1. Run the site locally:
    1. Open a `terminal` and navigate inside your cloned project.
    1. Use [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/) (Recommended, Free for linux):
       ```
       docker run --rm \
          --volume="$PWD:/srv/jekyll" \
          -p 4000:4000 \
          -it jekyll/jekyll \
          jekyll serve
       ```
       OR... [install Jekyll manually](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/).

       Then, run `jekyll serve` or `bundle exec jekyll serve` to run the site.
    1. Now the site is available at `http://localhost:4000` it will _automagically_ reload every time a file is saved.
1. Create new changes (Add an article, update the navbar, etc.).
    * Instructions for common changes are described in the rest of this post.
1. Push your new branch to _your fork_.
1. Create a [pull request](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-pull-requests) to `master` on [thetensor-space/thetensor-space.github.io](https://github.com/thetensor-space/thetensor-space.github.io).
1. We will review your pull request and either request changes or _approve it_ and merge your changes to `master`.
1. The site will automatically refresh with any new changes within a few minutes.
