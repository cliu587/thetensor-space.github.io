There are numerous potential meanings for a tensor, most relate in some fashion to a multilinear structure.  To obtain a  uniform definition of a tensor one may mimic the situation for vectors.  Just as a vector is simply an element of vector space, we say _tensor_ is an element of a _tensor space_.  To define a tensor space 

This leaves us to define a tensor space in a manner 

so a common definition of a tensor can be sought by appealing to a type of information In such a situation it helps not to define tensors but rather to define the type of information they represent.  For example, today vectors can take multiple forms, e.g. as lists of numbers, as arrows, as functions, and so on.  Instead of describing these specific structures What gives vectors their specific properties are the most suitable definition is one that abstracts 


A _tensor_ is an element of a _tensor space_ in much the same way that one defines a _vector_ as an element of _vector space_.  

In fact vector spaces are a special case of tensor spaces.

Common examples of tensor spaces are types of data that from a regular grid of numbers, for instance a 


Originally the term _tensor_ was introduced in Hamilton's _Elements of Quanternions_ to mean the length $\|x\|$ of a quaternion number $\mathbf{x}=a\mathbf{1}+b\mathbf{i}+c\mathbf{j}+d\mathbf{k}$.  The formula for this length under the Euclidean distance would be 
$$
\| x\| = \sqrt{a^2+b^2+c^2+d^2}
$$
Today that meaning is 
but today that meaning is rarely the one intended by the word.

A tensor is an element of a tensor space, similar to how a vector is an element of a vector space.
