**Abstract:** Concepts, examples, and notation of tensors can be quite varied, which presents a real barrier to communicating about problems and solutions regarding tensors.  Like vector spaces, **tensor spaces** make a uniform treatment possible without overriding any existing interpretation of individual tensors.  This bridges talk about tensors between varied disciplines.
