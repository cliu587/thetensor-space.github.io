**Abstract:** Attacks on the Group Isomorphism Problem have diversified in the last
decade with approaches ranging from Erd˝os-R´enyi type models, to hyper-graph
isomorphism techniques, and several representation and Lie theory methods. 
We will summarize necessary foundations and highlight important recent
progress while concentrating on examples.

As our main illustration, we will use a method from the study of groups of finite
Morley rank. We construct a family of non-isomorphic groups that share all
the same proper subgroups, all the same proper quotient groups, the same character
tables, and the same automorphism groups. This settles a question of Gowers
and Babai about the minimum requirements to decide isomorphism. And yet,
we also prove a polylogarithmic isomorphism test for this indistinguishable family
of groups. As these and other examples demonstrate we have a lot yet to learn
about most groups.
