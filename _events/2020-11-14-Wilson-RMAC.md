**Abstract** Solving simultaneous Sylvester equations in linear time.  James B. Wilson, Colorado State University, Joint work with Joshua Maglione, Bielefled.

XA-BX=C has been known as the Sylvester equation owing to a theorem that explains when a solution exists.  Its use to solve differential equations has made it a main stay in control theory through a process known as the Luneberger estimator.  The Bartles-Stewart algorithm is one of the classical solution of this problem.  In this take we demonstrate a tensor generalization and prove a linear time complexity.
