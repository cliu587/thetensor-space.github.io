<b>Title: <a href="https://slides.com/joshmaglione/taca2019"> A tensor playground: a demonstration of TensorSpace</a></b>

**Speaker:** <a href="https://joshmaglione.weebly.com/">Josh Maglione</a>, U. Bielefeld

**Abstract:** New algorithms for tensors change the way we compute with and manipulate tensors. Making room for modern theory while keeping the tried and true is the purpose of TensorSpace. We demonstrate how to build a tensor space system and apply it to known problems.
