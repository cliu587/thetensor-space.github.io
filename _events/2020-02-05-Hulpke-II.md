<b>Title: <a href="https://www.math.colostate.edu/~hulpke/talks/P19.pdf">Computational Group Theory</a> (tutorial)</b>

**Speaker:** <a href="https://www.math.colostate.edu/~hulpke/">Alexander Hulpke</a>, CSU

**Abstract:** These lectures are intended to give an overview of Concepts, Ideas, Tools, and Main results in Computational Group Theory (CGT), aimed at researchers who have just a basic idea of the concept of groups (knowing what a homomorphism is will be enough) but do not necessarily aim to specialize in the area. Focussing on the case of permutation groups and matrix groups, I will describe the what and why of the problems CGT considers, the assumptions that are made on input, the fundamental data structures that are used (and how they are constructed), and  some ways how these tools can be used in solving problems that are outside the scope of the basic algorithms.
