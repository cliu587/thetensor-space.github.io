**Abstract** We survey in brief and mathematically friendly informality the general concept of quantum phases of matter.  We conclude with the mathematical problems brought up by studying the boundary physics of these materials.  This is an introductory talk, more (and more accurate) detail can be found in work of Cirac and Verstraete.
