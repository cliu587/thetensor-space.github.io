<b>Title: Tensors &amp; Complexity (tutorial)</b>

**Speaker:** <a href="https://www.cs.colorado.edu/~jgrochow/" target="_blank">Joshua A. Grochow</a>, CU Boulder

**Abstract:** The first lecture will be about what computational complexity can tell us about tensors. We will review notions of reductions between problems, how we can use these notions of reduction to learn about computational difficulty. We will then cover what is known about the complexity of a variety of problems on tensors, including a first look at some very recent results (only going up on the arXiv this week!).

The second lecture will be about what tensors can tell us about computational complexity. We will see several ways - both direct and indirect - in which problems on tensors lie at the heart of lower bounds in complexity theory.
