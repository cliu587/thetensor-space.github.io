### Registration

Day-of, get a name tag, but no cost. Sponsored by Dept. Math. Colorado State University.

## Schedule

  In the tradition of Southwest Group Theory day, talks are planned throughout Saturday April 29 with the hope that collaborations and discussions can spill over to Sunday for those who can't usually meet together and use this as an   excuse to get together again.

#### Mandi A. Schaeffer Fry
**Title:** Recent Results on Local-Global Conjectures

**Abstract:** The local-global conjectures in character theory seek to relate the character theory of a finite group to the character theory and properties of certain nice, “local” subgroups. I will discuss some of these conjectures and recent progress.

**Title:** Realizing finite groups as automizers

**Abstract:** Motivated by a related question of P. Mueller, we wondered whether each finite group A could be realized as an automizer $\mathsf{Aut}_G(U)$ in some finite group $G$ with subgroup $U$. This is easy to do if $U$ is allowed to be normal in $G$, for then one can take a faithful representation of $A$ on an elementary abelian $p$-group $U$ for some prime $p$ and form the semidirect product $G = UA$. I will discuss joint work with Sylvia Bayard in which we are able to realize $A$ as an automizer $\mathsf{Aut}_G(U)$ even under the requirement that the $G$-conjugates of $U$ generate $G$. The method of construction is somewhat curious in that we do not know how to do it without using some initial pieces of the theory of fusion systems on finite groups.

#### Chris Liu 
**Title:** Quick solvers for endomorphisms of modules.

**Abstract:** Computing the endomorphism ring of a module over an algebra and the adjoint algebra of a bilinear map both require solving systems matrix equations of the form $XA_i + B_iY = C_i$. Given $A$, $B$, $C$ length $n$ lists of $n$-by-$n$ matrices we face a system of $n^3$ unknowns in $2n^2$ equations. This talk outlines an $O(n^3)$ solution in the general case. The key is to view $A,B,C$ as 3-tensors and apply invertible linear transformations that can be computed piecewise, in analogy to solving a linear system $Mx = b$ by left-multiplying by $M^{-1}$.

#### Peter Brooksbank
**Title:** Computing intersections of classical groups

**Abstract:**  Largely due to its applications to p-groups, understanding the intersection of a set of classical groups has long been a problem of interest in computational algebra. It reduces to the following computational problem: given a set of reflexive forms on a common vector space, construct generators for the group of invertible linear transformations that preserve every form in the set.

The first effective algorithms to solve the problem were developed for specific pairs of forms in joint work with E.A. O'Brien as long ago as 2008. More generally, by viewing the individual forms instead as a single bilinear map, the target group of isometries can be realized as the group of unitarian elements of an algebra with involution. This perspective was exploited in a joint 2012 paper with J.B. Wilson to develop a polynomial-time algorithm to solve the isometry group problem over finite fields of odd characteristic.

Unfortunately, the approach taken in the 2012 paper founders over fields of characteristic 2 in two significant ways, and despite continued interest in the problem this case has remained open for the past decade. In this talk I will present some recent developments with the characteristic 2 case. This is a report on joint work with M. Kassabov and J.B. Wilson.
