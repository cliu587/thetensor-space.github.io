<b>Title: On the complexity of MIN-RANK and its applications</b>

**Speaker:** <a href="http://www.cs.trincoll.edu/~miyazaki/" target="_blank">Takunari Miyazaki</a>, Trinity College

**Abstract:** The problem of finding a low-rank linear combination of matrices is a fundamental problem in linear algebra. Its decision version, called MIN-RANK, is also an important subject in computational complexity theory. In this talk, I will discuss MIN-RANK's fundamental properties and highlight its various roles in cryptography.
